A high-intensity close-up shot of a man riding a snowmobile at full speed through a dense snowy forest. The camera is locked in a frontal tracking shot, keeping the rider centered and slightly low-angled, emphasizing his focused expression and the roaring headlights of the snowmobile.Snow sprays violently to both sides in wide arcs as the machine carves through powder. The rider’s jacket flaps slightly from wind pressure. Falling snow particles pass the lens, some catching in the headlight beams. Subtle vibration adds realism to the snowmobile’s suspension.The background of pine trees blurs subtly from depth of field and motion speed. Light reflects off the snow surface with sharp cold tones.Visual FX: particle spray simulation, snow mist turbulence, high-lumen headlight glow, frost accumulation on gear.  Cinematic style: Arctic chase sequence + hyperreal realism.[Audio: deep engine roar + wind rush + granular snow impact, ENGLISH]
