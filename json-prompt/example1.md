Here’s the exact play we’re running right now with ChatGPT + JSON prompts in Veo 3 to pump out high-performing hook variations in minutes:

1️⃣ Start with a proven ad
Either:
→ A best-performer you want to keep scaling
→ Or a creative with potential but low thumbstop (<30%)

2️⃣ Pull the core angle + script
Extract the main idea, script, and visual flow. This is your “seed”.
Example: first-person POV spooning creatine → we turned it into 10x more chaotic visual ideas.

3️⃣ Prompt ChatGPT for Veo-style hooks
Prompt: “You’re a creative strategist at a top D2C agency. Based on this product, angle, and persona, give me 3–5 Veo 3-style hooks for Meta ads.”

Feed it:
→ Brand
→ Product + benefit
→ Core angle
→ Persona
→ Script/framework link

Output should be movement-heavy, cinematic, pattern-interrupt style setups.

4️⃣ Approve, then convert to JSON
Pick the best hook and say: “Turn this into a Veo 3 JSON script format, but wait for my approval before generating.”

JSON forces precision:
→ Camera type/movement
→ Character details
→ Lighting/style
→ Dialogue tone
→ Constraints (no logos/text/music)

5️⃣ Drop into Veo 3 and generate
→ Text to Video in Google Gemini > Flow
→ V3 Fast, 10p per shot, skip Quality mode (slower, no big gains)

6️⃣ Repeat fast
Test extremes:
→ Absurd (spoon on a rollercoaster)
→ Relatable (whiteboard explainer)
→ Visual metaphors (“brain fog” → room filling with smoke)

We pulled 7 hooks in 20 minutes last week using this loop.

Concept → generate → launch.
